# 100-DAY-ML-CHALLENGE
#100 DAY MACHINE LEARNING CHALLENGE 

### day:1 (7 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: I've successfully completed my first day of the 100 day machine learning challenge, i'm really exicted but as well  little intemidated by the math but i hope excitement overcome that fear of math, today i started following the tutorial of machine learning in python, i learned little bit about some probability as well as small overview of matplotlib grph library, today i got an overall idea of the concept but sure i need some recall over the probability concepts. 

 **Things learned**: 
                      
                      - PERCENTAIL AND MOMENT ( MEAN, VARIANCE, SKEW, KURTOSIS)
                      - MATPLOT LIB (LINE GRAPH, PIE, BAR, HISTOGRAM)
 

### day:2 (8 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: Today i listened videos on problity basics covering concepts like covariance, corelation, conditional probability, bayes theroem. but honestly i couldn't get my head around those concepts, they look simple at first then it becomes complicated, i have to practice those concepts well. today i was little tired to do this but some how i managed to allocate 1 hour time for this.

 **Things learned**: 
                      
                      - COVARIANCE, CORELATION, CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY, BAYE'S THEOREM (ONLY OVERALL VIEW)
                      

### day:3 (9 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: Today i looked into linear regression but initially it bit confusing but i could understand what is it purpose but i couldn't fully understand it. today was good and interesting.

 **Things learned**: 
                      
                      - LINEAR REGRESSION (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrjdcImgcQVyFbK04MBEhA)
 
 ### day:4 (10 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: Today is little boring day, i hardly found time to look into couple of video tutorial not able to do any coding. today i watched tutorial on statistics from youtube specially in linear regression and  what is normal distributiion, i feel i getting better in some concepts probability but i think this is not enough.

 **Things learned**: 
                      
                      - LINEAR REGRESSION
                      
 
 ### day:5 (11 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: Today, same like yesterday i couldn't code today but i'm going to watch some video tutorials. i don't want to miss the continuity by any chance.

 **Things learned**: 
                      
                      - UPDATE COMMING SOON
