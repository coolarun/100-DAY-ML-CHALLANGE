### day:1 (7 july 2018)
  
 
 **Today's Progress**: I've successfully completed my first day of the 100 day machine learning challenge, i'm really exicted but as well  little intemidated by the math but i hope excitement overcome that fear of math, today i started following the tutorial of machine learning in python, i learned little bit about some probability as well as small overview of matplotlib grph library, today i got an overall idea of the concept but sure i need some recall over the probability concepts. 

 **Things learned**:     
    > PERCENTAIL AND MOMENT ( MEAN, VARIANCE, SKEW, KURTOSIS)
    > MATPLOT LIB (LINE GRAPH, PIE, BAR, HISTOGRAM)
